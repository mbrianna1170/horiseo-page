<h1> Summary </h1>
<p> In this project I made changes to an already exsisting HTML and CSS file. I updated/consolidated the code and made it more accessible. 
<br>
<h2> Items that were updated: </h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed the title from "website" to a more descriptive name.</li>
<li>Added a nav to the header section for the listed items.</li>
<li>Seperated the hero section and added a note for it to be easier to read.</li>
<li> Changed the div class to article class="content" and added a section id for each area.</li>
<li> Changed the classes to "main-section" on each section id so that the code could become consolidated on the CSS sheet.</li>
<li> Changed line 51: div class="benefits" to (now line 76) aside class=side-bar and consolidated the code on the CSS sheet.</li>
<li> Added alt with descriptions to images. Also added alt="" to icons that do not need a description.</li>
<li> Overall spaced out code and added notes to show seperation of sections for an easier read.</li>
